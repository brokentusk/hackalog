<?php //First off, why does this exist and why is it in PHP? It scans log files for attempts to open admin pages and returns a list of IP addresses to block. It's in PHP because I am still getting up to speed in Rust. And yes I know there are better ways to do this than I wrote. A month of logs my test site was a little over a gig. To run the entire 31 files takes about 20 seconds running on my local laptop server. 
foreach(glob("logs/*[!-]?[!.txt]") as $filename) {

	$handle = @fopen($filename, "r"); //The log file name to look at. Yes this could be replaced by a dialog but I wanted the code to be short as possible. We set the folder to logs at the same level as hackalog. If you have a lot of logs, you will need to bump up execution time & memory or process in smaller chunks.
	$targetfile = @fopen("logs/hackalog.txt","a"); //Write the offending lines here. We work from files for two reasons, because often this info is sent to someone else and sending these lines to the browser can cause malicious code to execute. So let's package it up. We append instead of over writing so you can run a bunch of times and still end up with one list of IPs.
	if ($handle) {
		while (($buffer = fgets($handle, 4096)) !== false) { //Pull the info line by line. So giant log files can be processed without blowing up the browsers.
			if ((strpos($buffer,'admin')!==false or strpos($buffer,'base64')!==false) and strpos($buffer,'career')!=true){ // Look for admin and base64. You should be blocking base64 anyway but it doesn't hurt to look. We filter out the "career" section because if we list an administration job we want to leave those people alone.
				if (substr($buffer,0,3)<>"10."){ //Our admin pages are only accessible from in house. So any request from a 10.x.x.x address is ignored. Also the thing to disable if you are looking for a hack from an internal machine.
					fwrite($targetfile, $buffer); //Slap the offending line into the file

	//From here you could run a polish on the BadIPs.txt file to sort them by IP. However most of the time you would just email the bad ip list after reviewing the hackalog2.txt file for false positives. Like that time I banned a web security company hired without my knowledge to test our security minutes after they started.
